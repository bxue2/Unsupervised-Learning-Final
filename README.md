### BoardGameGeek Game Data Analysis:

The dataset I'll be analyzing contains scraped data from the website BoardGameGeek. The dataset should contain information on the various games that have earned enough user ratings on the website (30+ ratings). I'll be training a few models to see what works best at predicting user ratings with the available (or latent) features.
